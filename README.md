## Data Management Web Application

## ðŸš€ Introduction
The Data Management System is a  web application that allows users to upload Excel files containing specific data. The application validates the file structure and content, provides feedback on any validation errors, and saves the valid data into a database. Additionally, users can view the uploaded data and visualize it through a dashboard.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Upload `.xlsx` files via a user-friendly web interface.
- Validate the uploaded Excel file for required columns, data types, and formats.
- Report validation errors, including the ability to download a detailed error report.
- Insert valid data into a database.
- View uploaded data and manage records.
- Dashboard with visualizations showing the number of users based on age and gender.

## ðŸ›  Setup and Installation

### 3. File Structure Validation
- The uploaded Excel file must contain exactly five columns:
  1. `Sno`
  2. `FirstName`
  3. `LastName`
  4. `Gender`
  5. `DateofBirth`
- The application validates the presence and exact names of these columns. Any deviation results in a validation error.


### 4. Data Insertion:
- After successful validation, the data is inserted into a database table that mirrors the structure of the Excel file.
- Each upload is tracked with a unique identifier (e.g., `DUP0001`, `DUP0002`).
